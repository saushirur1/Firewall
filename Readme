a. Testing
--> I tested the code using different csv files which have different rules for the firewall (tried some cases using accept_packet() function 
in main).

b. Algorithmic choices
--> I used a map in map data structure to store direction and protocols to make the query faster at the expense of using more space.
--> A list was used in the inner map to store port_info type objects, these objects has port info and the IP ranges for quick access.
--> I implemented a function to check for the port numbers using binary search to reduce the search time (first wrote a normal
function then worked on a binary search function)

c.Optimization if I had more time
--> Merging IP ranges for easier search
--> The ports are searched using binary search as they are kept in sorted order, I wanted to sort the Ip's as well to reduce
the search time. 
--> If a CIDR notation was available then I could just use the subnet mask to make the search really fast.
